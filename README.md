# R Time Series Visualization to Model Financial Data

This tutorial shows how to use the `tidyquant` package in R to construct various time series graphs 
(both interactive and otherwise) of financial data. 

There are three versions of the same document:
1) .Rmd file contains the original R-markdown code to construct the tutorial
2) .html file contains the knitted html versions (download and open to play with interactive features)
3) .pdf file shows the graph outputs directly from GitHub, although interactive features can't be fully appreciated.
